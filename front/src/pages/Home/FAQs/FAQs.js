              If you have a long transfer duration, after getting off your train, you may want to
              ask station staff whether there's a way to directly access the waiting area for your
              connecting train. If there isn't, you'll need to exit and re-enter the station.

              If the transfer duration is short, after getting off at the transfer station, we
              recommend asking station staff how to get to the platform for your connecting train.

              If you are unable to make your connecting train because the first train on your
              itinerary was delayed, you can change your ticket to another train departing on the
              same day before 23:59. If you're unable to change your ticket, please go to a station
              ticket window and request a refund. Generally, there won't be a fee for doing this,
              but policies vary by station, and Goticket cannot accept liability in the event you
              are charged.
